ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DataSpi.
Iâ€™m a learning animal currently embarking on the journey of crunching number. Iâ€™m currently learning to become a professional Data Analyst, and maybe a Data Scientist in the future. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project related to analysing data, especially data related to Human Resources. I am also interested in NLP AI so I would love to have some connection with people having knowledge in this area
