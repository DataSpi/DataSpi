ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DataSpi.

I am a self-studying Data Analyst with a short-term goal of becoming a Data Analyst and a long-term goal of becoming a Data Scientist. 

I began learning Python on May 20, 2023 (which is not really long until the point of writing this introduction Nov 10, 2023). During this time, I've found out that I am a passionate learner on a journey to master the art of data analysis. I have a natural curiosity for data and enjoy the process of analyzing it. 

I have come a long way since I started my journey. In just six months, I have completed several projects that have given me a sense of optimism about my future in the field of Data Science.

The projects I have worked on over the past six months include:

- [Conducting a survey on stress and mental health status among employees of a company](https://www.notion.so/homeofkiemidea/Survey-about-Mental-Health-Stress-status-of-ITL-Employees-Aug2023-a4e3286b13f34e5a933361d19f796e76?pvs=4)
- [Creating labor market reports using data scraped from job listing sites](https://github.com/DataSpi/scraping-jobs)
- [Building an internal AI assistant using LLMs like ChatGPT](https://github.com/DataSpi/itl-inno-award-2023)

If you are interested, please check out the links I have attached. I am currently looking for people to learn and collaborate with on my open-source projects. Feel free to contact me via email at spino.kiem@itlvn.com.
